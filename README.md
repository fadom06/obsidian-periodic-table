# obsidian-periodic-table
An obsidian plugin that adds a simplistic, color-coded, and interactive periodic table to your notes that links to custom made notes about the respective elements.

## Installation
1. Install main.js and manifest.json.
2. Create folder under .obsidian/plugins call it "periodic-table-widget" or whatever.
3. Move main and manifest into newly made folder.
4. Open Obsidian and load plugin as usual.

## Usage
To see the table, open any note and insert it using a [code block](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#Code+blocks) and the keyword `periodic-table`.
The periodic table should now be visible as an interactive svg.
When clicking on an element you will be linked to the respective note (which you can create on your own or will be able to download collectively from the (soon to be) provided zip).

## Modifications and Possibilities
All colors and animations can be easily modified in the main.js file using basic css.
